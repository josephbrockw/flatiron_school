# One-sample z-test - Lab

### Introduction
In this lab we will go through quick tests to help you better understand the ideas around hypothesis testing.

## Objectives
You would be able to
* Understand and explain use cases for a 1-sample z-test
* Set up null and alternative hypotheses
* Calculate z statistic using z-tables and cdf functions
* Calculate and interpret p-value for significance of results.

## Exercise 1
A rental car company claims the mean time to rent a car on their website is 60 seconds with a standard deviation of 30 seconds. A random sample of 36 customers attempted to rent a car on the website. The mean time to rent was 75 seconds. Is this enough evidence to contradict the company's claim?

Follow the 5 steps shown in previous lesson and use alpha = 0.05. 


```python
# State you null and alternative hypotheses

```


```python
# Your solution here


# (p = 0.0013498980316301035, z = 3.0)
```


```python
# Interpret the results in terms of p-value obtained


```

## Exercise 2

Twenty five students complete a preparation program for taking the SAT test.  Here are the SAT scores from the 25 students who completed  program:

``
434 694 457 534 720 400 484 478 610 641 425 636 454
514 563 370 499 640 501 625 612 471 598 509 531
``

We know that the population average for SAT scores is 500 with a standard deviation of 100.

The question is, are these studentsâ€™ SAT scores significantly greater than a population mean? 

*Note that the the maker of the SAT prep program claims that it will increase (and not decrease) your SAT score.  So, you would be justified in conducting a one-directional test. (alpha = .05).*




```python
# State your hypotheses 

```


```python
# Give your solution here 



# p = 0.03593031911292577, z = 1.8
```


```python
# Interpret the results in terms of p-value obtained

```

## Summary

In this lesson, we conducted a couple of simple tests comparing sample and population means, in an attempt to reject our null hypotheses. This provides you with a strong foundation to move ahead with more advanced tests and approaches in statistics.
